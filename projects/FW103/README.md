    General guidelines
    These are just guidelines, not strict rules - document however seems best.
    A README for a firmware-only project (e.g. Babydriver, MPXE, bootloader, CAN explorer) should answer the following questions:
        - What is it?
        - What problem does it solve?
        - How do I use it? (with usage examples / example commands, etc)
        - How does it work? (architectural overview)
    A README for a board project (powering a hardware board, e.g. power distribution, centre console, charger, BMS carrier) should answer the following questions:
        - What is the purpose of the board?
        - What are all the things that the firmware needs to do?
        - How does it fit into the overall system?
        - How does it work? (architectural overview, e.g. what each module's purpose is or how data flows through the firmware)
