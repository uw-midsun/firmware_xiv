# pylint: skip-file
TODO:

- Review implementation, suggestions
- Ask for strategies for testing




FEEDBACK:
- Create a listener class to get rid of asyncio stuff
- Create a receiver class that handles listeners
    - Remember that callback should be called on DATAGRAM, not message
- Create a sender class that takes info from the datagram class and sends it
- Create a datagram class that creates the datagram byte array from the input data 
    - Note that num nodes acts a lot like data size
    - Note that crc32 needs to be calculated (LOOK INTO THIS)
        - Compare crc32 calculation with the one in c
