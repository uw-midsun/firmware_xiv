## Uncommitted codegen changes detected!

It looks like the generated header files in libraries/codegen-tooling don't match the CAN message
definition file at codegen/can_messages.asciipb. If you've changed the CAN message definitions,
please run `make codegen` locally and push the changes.

Alternatively, maybe you've edited can_messages.asciipb in the [codegen-tooling-msxiv][1] repo. This
[has been deprecated][2]: please make your changes to codegen/can_messages.asciipb instead.
