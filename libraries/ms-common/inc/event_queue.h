// Global event queue
//
// Uses an array of FIFOs to prioritize events of lower priority. Only one
// global instance exists.
//
// Implementation:
// - Event Queue consists of five FIFOs each of which correspond to a priority.
// - Raised events are put into the corresponding FIFO.
// - A processed event will come from the highest priority queue that has
// elements.
//
// For legacy purposes and simplicity for smaller projects |event_raise()|
// allows events to be raised at the NORMAL (default) priority. In cases where
// this is prevalent high priority events will preempt most ms-common and
// ms-helper functionality as well as any board behavior. Additionally, low
// priority message will effectively become best effort as many events may be
// raised.
